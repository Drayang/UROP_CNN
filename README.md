Research Title: Rethinking of AI Deep Learning for Intelligent Vehicle Recognition System: An Exploratory Research

Download the files in sv_data folder so the python code can work properly.

Preprocessing the image into .npz file using Image_processing.py to save the time to process the images when training the model.

Name the npz.file as Car.npz 


Description of the files as follows-

Image_processing.py : Process CompCar image into numpy array form and store as .npz file (MUST done first)

Code_1.py : Very basic CNN model for vehicle recognition 

Code_2.py : Adding more api function into the model
